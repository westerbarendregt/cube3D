# cube3D

Creating a raycasting, first person shooting game from scratch. 
Not using any tutorials to see if I could create new mathematical formulas. 

This was an succes through some algorithms and I could raycast the sprites in real time, generating it every pixel at a time. 
Instead of pasting layers on top of each other. 

Take a look at: https://github.com/wbarendr/cube3D/blob/master/3Dcube/mandatory_files/spritehit_x.c to see how I did some of this.
