# cube3D

Creating a raycasting, first person shooting game from scratch. 
Not using any tutorials to see if I could create new mathematical formulas. 

This was a succes through some algorithms and I could raycast the sprites in real time, generating it every pixel at a time. 
Instead of pasting layers on top of each other. 

Take a look at: https://github.com/wbarendr/cube3D/blob/master/3Dcube/mandatory_files/spritehit_x.c to see how I did some of this. 

To play the game go to srcs:

RUN: Make bonus 

RUN: ./cub3D file.cub

walk with: [wasd] && spin with arrow keys
